              Disclaimer
            </h2>
            Please check all details of conference organizers carefully before
            making arrangements to attend an event, or paying money to
            organizers.
            <br />
            <br />
            ExhiFairs checks event details to the best of our ability; but the
            final responsibility of ensuring that an event is bona fide rests
            with you as a potential conference goer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please also be wary of event websites using the ExhiFairs logo to
            try and gain status and/or credibility for their event. ExhiFairs
            does not have any media partnerships with event organizers and has
            not given permission to organizers to use the ExhiFairs logo.
